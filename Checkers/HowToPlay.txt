Select between one and two player modes.
One player: choose a difficulty and your team color. Two player: you are ready to start your game.
Click 'New Game'. Yellow always starts first.

Objective: eliminate all opposing checkers or create a situation in which it is impossible for your opponent to make any move.

As stated above, yellow moves first and plays proceed alternately. From their initial positions, checkers may only move forward (toward the opposite end of the board). There are two types of moves that can be made, capturing moves and non-capturing moves. Non-capturing moves are simply a diagonal move forward from one square to an adjacent square. (Note that the black squares are never used.) Capturing moves occur when a player "jumps" an opposing piece. This is also done on the diagonal and can only happen when the square behind (on the same diagonal) is also open; this is where you land. This means that you may not jump an opposing piece around a corner.

King Pieces: Upon reaching the opponent's back-most row, your piece becomes a King. Kings can move in any diagonal direction.

Capturing Move: On a capturing move, a piece may make multiple jumps. If after a jump a player is in a position to make another jump then he may do so. This means that a player may make several jumps in succession, capturing several pieces on a single turn.

Forced Captures: When a player is in a position to make a capturing move, he must make a capturing move. When he has more than one capturing move to choose from he may take whichever move suits him.
